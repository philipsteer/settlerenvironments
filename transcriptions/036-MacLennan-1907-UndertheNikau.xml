               <l> I'm singing a song to you[,] South, </l>
               <l> Here in the northern shade— </l>
               <l> A song that is sung by the mouth </l>
               <l> Of the spirit that dwells in the glade. </l>
               <l> It breathes of the lichen and moss, </l>
               <l> Its rhythm is peacefully calm, </l>
               <l> And glides through the sunbeams that glimmer across, </l>
               <l> Under the Nikau palm.<note> Nikau palm. The nikau, New Zealand’s only native palm, is found in the North Island and as far south as the Canterbury region in the South Island. </note> </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> The fantails<note> Fantails. Pīwakawaka, or the fantail, is a gregarious and acrobatic bird that feeds on insects. </note> are twitt’ring above, </l>
               <l> Full nimbly they’re dancing among </l>
               <l> The branches; whilst, brimming with love, </l>
               <l> The blackbird<note> Blackbird. The blackbird was introduced to New Zealand in the 1860s and 1870s. </note> is chanting his song. </l>
               <l> The soul of the forest’s awake, </l>
               <l> Emitting its heart-healing balm, </l>
               <l> That floats in the shadow for melody’s sake, </l>
               <l> Under the Nikau palm. </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> There’s rapture in manifold green </l>
               <l> That reigns in the valley alone, </l>
               <l> There’s love in its grandeur serene, </l>
               <l> And love hath a way of its own </l>
               <l> Of taking the flowers to its breast, </l>
               <l> And giving a voice to the psalm </l>
               <l> That floats through the forest at eventide, </l>
               <l> Under the Nikau palm. </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> Then listen, dear South, to the song </l>
               <l> That lovers unconsciously learn, </l>
               <l> Who rest for a season among </l>
               <l> The gullies of sensitive fern. </l>
               <l> ‘Tis fronded and restful and free, </l>
               <l> Heart healing, consoling, and calm, </l>
               <l> The sylvan song in the northern shade, </l>
               <l> Under the Nikau palm. </l>
