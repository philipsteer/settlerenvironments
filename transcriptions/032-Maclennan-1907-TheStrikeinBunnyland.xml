The export of frozen rabbit carcasses to Britain began in the mid-1890s, and more than six million carcasses were exported annually by the turn of the century, primarily from the southern regions of the South Island.

Strikes by workers’ unions had been banned under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act (1890), which established compulsory arbitration with employers, but industrial unrest began to grow around the turn of the twentieth century with the emergence of socialist and revolutionary union movements. </note> </l>
