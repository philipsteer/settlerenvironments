               <l> A toil-worn city dweller, </l>
               <l> Fair visions come to me </l>
               <l> Of the sweet, cool, green translucence, </l>
               <l> Under the greenwood tree: </l>
               <l> This pleasant vision rises </l>
               <l> Again, and yet again, </l>
               <l> Till I go where green leaves rustle, </l>
               <l> Far from the haunts of men— </l>

           <lg>
               <l> I follow the winding streamlet </l>
               <l> Up its moss-grown boulder bed— </l>
               <l> The craggy rocks up-rising </l>

               <l> The laurel<note> Laurel. There are several indigenous Australian species of laurel, but many of these are tropical trees, and the poem possibly refers to the camphor laurel, which spread rapidly after being introduced in New South Wales in the 1820s. </note> and the wattle<note> Wattle. There are over 1,000 species of acacia, or wattle, that are indigenous to Australia, although most grow in arid or semi-arid regions unlike that described in the poem. </note> </l>

               <l> The morning sun down streameth </l>
               <l> With all his radiance bright; </l>
               <l> Each tree-top lies a-basking </l>
               <l> In blaze of golden light; </l>
               <l> He peepeth through the branches, </l>
               <l> And merrily plays bo-peep </l>
               <l> With the sweet, shy flowerets peeping </l>
               <l> From <sic>nooklets</sic> cool and deep, </l>
               <l> While they blush at being wakened </l>
               <l> By his kisses from their sleep. </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> At noonday, growing bolder, </l>
               <l> How ardent are his beams; </l>
               <l> He clasps within his brightness </l>
               <l> The rocks, and trees, and streams; </l>
               <l> Flowers droop beneath his ardour, </l>
               <l> And hide their glowing face, </l>
               <l> While his blazing eyes are searching </l>
               <l> The secrets of each place, </l>
               <l> And his <sic>langourous</sic> love-kisses </l>

           <lg>
               <l> At sunset, ere he goeth, </l>

               <l> Flung from the western sky; </l>
               <l> The flow’rets, peeping upward, </l>
               <l> Say, “Love, dear love, good night;” </l>
               <l> While towering eucalypti </l>
               <l> Bathe in his glowing light, </l>
               <l> And give back kiss for kisses, </l>
               <l> Till fall the shades of night. </l>

           <lg>
               <l> Sweet is thy calm, O Burwood! </l>
               <l> Far up thy lovely glen, </l>
               <l> In thy Dryad-haunted bowers,<note> Dryad-haunted bowers. The dryad is a wood nymph, according to Greek mythology. </note> </l>
               <l> Far from the haunts of men, </l>
               <l> I have passed a day of quiet, </l>
               <l> I have passed a day of rest; </l>
               <l> And from all the things around me </l>
               <l> I have drawn some happy zest; </l>
               <l> For Nature, there, has shown me </l>
               <l> Her loveliest and best. </l>
