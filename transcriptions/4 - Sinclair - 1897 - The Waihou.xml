              <l> Peacefully, tranquilly, on to the sea— </l>
              <l> Flow, river, flow; </l>
              <l> Music, thy soft dreamy murmur shall be— </l>
              <l> Flow, river, flow. </l>
              <l> Once on thy green banks I stood not alone; </l>
              <l> Once here I listened to friendship’s sweet tone; </l>
              <l> Pleasure and sorrow since then I have known— </l>
              <l> Flow, river, flow. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l> Time, like thy current, rolls ceaselessly on— </l>
               <l> Flow, river, flow; </l>
               <l> Mournful or happy, the days are soon gone— </l>
               <l> Flow, river, flow. </l>
               <l> Sometimes how radiant is Life’s azure sky, </l>
               <l> Sometimes across it how sullen clouds fly! </l>
               <l> Onward, like thee, through all change we must hie— </l>
               <l> Flow, river, flow. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
                <l> On to thy rest in the ocean of blue— </l>
                <l> Flow, river, flow; </l>
                <l> Gliding so swiftly away beyond view— </l>
                <l> Flow, river, flow. </l>
                <l> Will every ripple keep sparkling and bright, </l>
                <l> Glancing and flashing in golden sunlight? </l>
                <l> Nay, for soon cometh the shadowing night— </l>
                <l> Flow, river, flow. </l>
            </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> Sages find lessons of wisdom in thee— </l>
               <l> Flow, river, flow; </l>
               <l> Memories fond have endeared thee to me— </l>
               <l> Flow, river, flow. </l>
               <l> There by thy side the dim twilight I’d spend; </l>
               <l> Well with my musing thy rhythm doth blend; </l>
               <l> Onward and nearer thou’lt be to my friend— </l>
               <l> Flow, river, flow. </l>
