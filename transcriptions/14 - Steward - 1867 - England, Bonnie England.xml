           </lg>
           <lg>

               <l> In the soft and balmy air, </l>
               <l> And the murmur of the river </l>

           <lg>

           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> Loud the screaming of the ka-ka<note>Ka-ka. Kaka, a large, brown, forest-dwelling parrot.</note> </l>
               <l> Rings upon the startled ear, </l>

               <l> Hops about me bright and bold, </l>
           </lg>

               <l> Light upon me as I lie, </l>

               <l> Swift pursue the darting fly; </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> Feather-like the graceful fern-tree </l>

               <l> And the <sic>fuschia-trees</sic><note>Fuschia-trees. Kōtukutuku, or the fuchsia tree, is considered the world’s largest species of fuchsia.</note> around me </l>
               <l> Thick their crimson blossoms shed; </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> And the busy bees are droning </l>
               <l> Sweetly on the spicy air, </l>
               <l> Oh this world is very lovely! </l>
               <l> This New Zealand very fair! </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> Yet O England! bonnie England! </l>
               <l> All my thoughts are now of thee, </l>
               <l> And this beautiful New Zealand </l>
               <l> Is not half so dear to me;</l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> Tho’ it were a very Eden </l>
               <l> Yet a stranger here I roam, </l>
               <l> And my heart with fondest yearning </l>
               <l> Sighs for England and for home. </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> Tho’ these woods were ever ringing </l>
               <l> With the sweetest notes of earth, </l>
               <l> More, to me, a robin singing </l>
               <l> In an apple-tree were worth; </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> E’en an humble sparrow’s chatter, </l>
               <l> More should please my longing ear, </l>
               <l> Than the song of all the songsters </l>
               <l> That awake the echoes here. </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> Grand is this primeval forest, </l>
               <l> Yet I’d give it all to look </l>
               <l> On an English elm, and listen </l>
               <l> To the cawing o’ the rook. </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> England! England! bonnie England! </l>
               <l> Let me see thy rock-bound shore! </l>
               <l> Let me tread thy hills and valleys, </l>
               <l> And thy daisied fields once more! </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> And tho’ this should be denied me, </l>
               <l> Lovely land that gave me birth, </l>
               <l> Let my sleeping ashes mingle </l>
               <l> Fondly, with thy sacred earth! </l>
           </lg>
           <lg>
               <l> Then—when springing daisies cluster </l>
               <l> O’er the turf, above my breast,— </l>
               <l> With thine arms about me, sweetly </l>
               <l> As an infant I shall rest. </l>
