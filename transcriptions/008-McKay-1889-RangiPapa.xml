                <p>[The story of Rangi and Papa <note>Ranginui, the sky father, and Papatūānuku, the earth mother.</note> is told with different details by collectors of Maori lore; but the main facts of the legend are these:—Rangi and Papa were the primeval pair from whom descended not only the race of men, but the other powers of the world, both vegetable and animal. In their anger at being kept in darkness, all their children, except the God of the winds, rebelled and pushed their father Rangi up into the sky, and left Papa below. Thus husband and wife were separated for ever, but their love and sorrow still continue. Their descendant Maui <note>A legendary Polynesian trickster hero.</note> is generally regarded as the Maori Adam; his exploits in fishing up the North Island of New Zealand, and in noosing and wounding the sun and moon that the earth might not want light, are famous in Maori tradition.] <note>The headnote is by McKay.</note></p>
