               <l> Oh, sing once more, </l>
               <l> Again out pour, </l>
               <l> Like some long-applauded mimer </l>
               <l> All thy vocal store. </l>

               <l > Thy short but oft-repeated song, </l>
               <l> At early dawn<note> Early dawn. The bellbird’s most distinctive call is heard around dawn, when many of the species are present. </note> </l>
               <l> Awakes the morn, </l>
               <l> Telling that joys to thee belong, </l>

               <l> For thou seem’st doomed to disappear, </l>

               <l> Some say the stranger honey-bee, </l>

               <l> This ill hath wrought; </l>
               <l> It steals the honey from the tree, </l>
               <l> And it leaves thee naught.<note> Naught. Settlers had debated since at least the 1860s that the introduction of bees was providing competition for nectar-eating indigenous species such as the bellbird. </note> </l>

               <l> Thy chiming strain, </l>
               <l> Thy purple throat and olive hue:<note> Purple throat and olive hue. The male bellbird is olive green, with a purple-tinted head. </note> </l>
               <l> Yet we wish in vain.<note> Vain. The bellbird was listed a few years later as a protected species under the 1886 amendment to the Animal Protection Act (1880), which allowed for the Governor “to prohibit absolutely or for such time as he may think fit the destruction of any bird indigenous to the colony.” </note> </l>
