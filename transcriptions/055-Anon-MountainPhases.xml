               <l> As giants<note> Giants. The poem describes the mountains of the Tararua Range, which border the western edge of the Wairarapa plains. </note> of dark midnight born; </l>
               <l> Waiting for the op’ning day, </l>
               <l> Catching high its earliest ray, </l>
               <l> Like beacons to the valley deep, </l>
               <l> Waking up its life from sleep. </l>
               <l> Mists up-gath’ring from beneath, </l>
               <l> Out river beds and sedgy heath; </l>
               <l> While, in easy grace arising, </l>
               <l> Ever varying forms devising. </l>
               <l> And clothing all from head to feet </l>
               <l> In dripping rain and colder sleet; </l>
               <l> And the wind, in fitful chases, </l>
               <l> Up the steeps and down the faces; </l>
               <l> Clearing off, and bringing on </l>
               <l> Gleams of sunshine all day long, </l>
               <l> Till, the sun, in evening’s round, </l>
               <l> Clears all off in calm profound. </l>
               <l> Then, in purple tinted dress, </l>
               <l> Beams the richest loveliness: </l>
               <l> Azure depths, and golden streaks, </l>
               <l> Mark the slopes and pointed peaks. </l>
               <l> And, nobler too, in outline free, </l>
               <l> Far as far as eye can see, </l>
               <l> Fading in the distant blue, </l>
               <l> Richer than the morning’s hue. </l>
               <l> But the shadows dimmer grow </l>
               <l> In the evening’s darker glow; </l>
               <l> When the blacker shades of night </l>
               <l> Shut all in from human sight. </l>
