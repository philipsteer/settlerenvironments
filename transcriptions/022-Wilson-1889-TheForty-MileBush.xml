               <l> Far through the forest’s<note> Forest. The Forty-Mile Bush was an area of dense forest in the Wairarapa region, on the opposite coast of the North Island to Wilson’s home, which was cleared during the 1870s and 1880s in large part by Scandinavian settlers brought to New Zealand by assisted migration schemes. </note> aromatic glade </l>
               <l> We rode one afternoon of golden ease. </l>
               <l> The long road ran through sunshine and through shade, </l>
               <l> Lulled by the somnolent stories of the trees. </l>

               <l> Soft lay the moss, like furs upon the floor. </l>

               <l> Of lonely peak and spectral mountain-head, </l>
